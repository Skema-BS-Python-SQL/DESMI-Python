# Operator, Name, Example
x = 5
y = 3
# ==	Equal	x == y
# returns False because 5 is not equal to 3
print(x == y)

# returns True because 5 is not equal to 3
#!=	Not equal	x != y
print(x != y)

#>	Greater than	x > y	
# returns True because 5 is greater than 3
print(x > y)

#<	Less than	x < y	
# returns False because 5 is not less than 3
print(x < y)

#>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
# returns True because five is greater, or equal, to 3
print(x >= y)

#<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y
# returns False because 5 is neither less than or equal to 3
print(x <= y)
