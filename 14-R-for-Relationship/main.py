# How well does my data fit in a linear regression?
from scipy import stats

x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)

print(round(r, 2))

# The result -0.76 shows that there is a relationship, not perfect, but it indicates that we could use linear regression in future predictions.
